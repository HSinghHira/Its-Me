  Welcome to my super cool corner of the internet! 🌐✨ <br><br> I'm <b>Harman Singh Hira</b> but most people call me by my last name, Hira 💎
desc: >
  So, I was born in Chandigarh, India 🇮🇳 but in my early 20s, I made the big move to the beautiful island of New Zealand 🇳🇿.
  I finished all my studies back home, then added a diploma in Business Management & Leadership here just to keep things spicy 🎓✨
  <br><br>

  Now rewind to when I was 15... while most of my friends were busy gaming 🎮, I was that one kid messing around with code 💻.
  I started building websites, making templates, and yep, even sold a few for some decent cash 💸.
  Also had a tech blog that actually made money through Google AdSense at just 16! Crazy right? 🤯
  Oh, and fun fact: I never studied IT in school. Everything I know? Self-taught. YouTube + curiosity = the real MVPs 🤝📺
  <br><br>

  After moving to NZ, life got a bit busy. I had a full-time job (not in tech, more like pizza deliveries 🍕🚗) and study life.
  So coding kind of took a pause. But I realized I missed it. Like, a lot.
  It's my kind of therapy: just me, the screen, and vibes 💡✨
  Started learning again, built some random tools (including some I totally regret, don't ask 😅), and got back into the groove.
  <br><br>

  These days, I'm still deep-diving into all things tech, even though I work in a completely different industry.
  Why not full-time dev work? Tbh, the moment coding feels like work instead of fun, I lose all motivation 💀.
  I like building stuff on my own terms — when it's fun, not forced.
  <br><br>

  Right now, I'm happily married (wife's literally sitting next to me as I type this 😄💍), love binge-watching movies 🎬, exploring new places ✈️, learning random things 🧠, and yeah... FOOD.
  Huge foodie here 🍜 and not to brag, but I'm kinda decent in the kitchen too 👨‍🍳🔥
  <br><br>

  Anyway, that's a lil' peek into my story.
  Thanks for stopping by!
  <br><br>

  Cheers 🥂
