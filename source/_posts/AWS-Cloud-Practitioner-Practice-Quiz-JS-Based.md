This quiz may not have all the bells and whistles, but it has all the essential features you'd expect from any quiz website. 🎯 Here's what you can expect:

**1. Colorful Feedback: ** When you select a wrong answer, it will be highlighted in red, while the correct answer will be highlighted in green. 🟥🟩 This way, you'll know exactly where you went wrong and where you excelled.

**2. Customizable Questions:** You can set the number of questions you want to tackle. 📝 Behind the scenes, you can add as many questions as you want, giving you the flexibility to challenge yourself at your own pace.

**3. Randomized Questions: ** Each time you take the quiz, it will present you with random questions and options. 🎲 This keeps things exciting and ensures that you never know what the next question will be. It's like a surprise every time!

To make this quiz possible, I used the power of JavaScript. 🚀 By leveraging JavaScript, I was able to create a dynamic experience for you, right on a static webpage. How cool is that? 💻

For the visual styling, I employed the popular CSS framework called Bootstrap v5.1.0. 🎨 This helped me quickly achieve a clean and professional look without spending too much time on the aesthetics. And of course, what's a quiz without some icons? I used the awesome Font Awesome Icons to give the quiz a touch of visual appeal. 🌟

I must admit, this quiz was a bit of a rush project. So, while I didn't spend a lot of time on its looks, I made sure it works perfectly and offers you plenty of options to enhance your learning experience. 📚

I hope you find this quiz both educational and enjoyable. Give it a try, challenge yourself, and let's see how well you know your AWS Cloud Practitioner knowledge! Remember, learning can be fun too! 🌈📚💡
