This time, it’s all about creating a static website using the powerful Google Custom Search script for searching Apple’s iOS Shortcuts. So, buckle up and get ready to dive into the world of web development!</p>\n<p>When I embarked on this project, my goal was clear: to create a website with a simple design that would provide an efficient way to search for Apple’s iOS Shortcuts. I opted for a straightforward design without delving too much into complex CSS. The result? A website that wasn’t bad looking, but perhaps not the most visually striking. 😅</p>\n<p>Creating this website turned out to be an incredibly easy project, thanks to the magic of Google Custom Search. All I had to do was add the iOS Shortcut directories’ websites to the Google Custom Search dashboard, and voila! The script provided a seamless search experience for users on my webpage. It was a breeze! 💨</p>\n<p>If you’re curious to explore the website I created, you can click on the link below. Go ahead and give it a try! Who knows, you might discover some amazing iOS Shortcuts that will make your Apple device even more powerful and efficient. 🚀</p>\n<p>So, if you’re in need of finding iOS Shortcuts or simply want to explore the world of Apple’s shortcuts, feel free to check out the website. Happy searching, and may your Apple device become even more amazing with the power of iOS Shortcuts! 📱✨</p>\n",

Brace yourself for a tale of intrigue, innovation, and a touch of darkness!</p>\n<p>But First, What on Earth is Muerte KOD? 😯❓</p>\n<p>I know, I know, the name might raise a few eyebrows. So, let me clarify: Muerte, which means “death” or “murder” in English, was a “legal” Windows software designed to enhance the gaming experience for the immensely popular game, PUBG Mobile. Now, before you call the authorities on me, let me assure you that the software itself didn’t do anything wrong. It simply consisted of a collection of small tools aimed at helping players enjoy the game to the fullest. 😅🔧</p>\n<p>Creating Muerte KOD was both a challenge and an opportunity for me. It marked my first and, so far, my last venture into software development using Microsoft Visual Studio. I poured my heart and soul into this project, striving to provide as many useful features as possible for the gamers. 💪</p>\n<p>I dedicated countless hours to refining the software, ensuring that it not only delivered the desired functionality but also boasted an improved visual design. After all, a visually appealing interface can truly elevate the gaming experience. 🚀🎨</p>\n<p>Muerte KOD, with its name meaning “death” or “murder” in English, added an extra layer of intrigue to this exhilarating journey. Although the software aimed to enhance gameplay through various tools like MAC address spoofing, Defender Injector, Flush DNS, Advanced DNS Changer, HDD ID Changer, and more, it’s important to note that it was all within the realm of legality. No rules were broken, I promise! 😉🔒</p>\n<p>While Muerte KOD stands as my first and, for now, my last software endeavor using Microsoft Visual Studio, I cherish the experience and the knowledge gained along the way. It serves as a testament to the limitless possibilities that await us in the realm of game enhancement.</p>\n<p>So, fellow gamers, keep exploring, keep innovating, and let’s continue to push the boundaries of what we can achieve in the world! Game on! 🎮🌟</p>\n",

It all started with a simple task: putting dough tags on newly made dough batches. It was a crucial health and safety requirement, and I hope they still follow it. But little did I know that this experience would lead me down a rabbit hole of Excel wonders. 🎩💻</p>\n<p>One day, during a not-so-busy shift, I couldn’t help but notice that the dough tags we were using weren’t exactly visually appealing. You know, they lacked that wow factor. 🤔 So, when I got home, I decided to fire up Excel on my laptop to see if I could create better-looking tags. A quick Google search for inspiration, and voila! I had some good-looking tags ready to go. 🏷️🌟</p>\n<p>But then, it hit me. I would still have to manually enter all the details for each tag. 🙇‍♀️ Determined to find a solution, I hit the search button once again and stumbled upon the magnificent world of Macros and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications for full, I know fancy name 😑). 🚀</p>\n<p>With newfound knowledge, I started with a simple file. It was nothing fancy, just a basic automation to ease the manual data entry process. Little did I know that this was just the beginning of an exciting journey. Every step of the way, I continued to develop and improve my Excel project. 📈</p>\n<p>In the end, I created something truly remarkable. If you’re curious to see the different versions I released, head over to the GitHub repository. Unfortunately, I must confess that I no longer remember the password for the VBA, so you won’t be able to view the codes behind the magic. 🧙‍♂️ (maybe decrypt the file and tell me the password too 🤣)</p>\n<p>This project is a true testament to the wonders of Excel and VBA. Despite not remembering much about VBA or even how to perform simple calculations in Excel, I somehow managed to create this masterpiece. It’s like a puzzle I solved without remembering how I did it. 🧩💡</p>\n<p>And guess what? If the need arises, I can create an even better Excel project than this one. Trust me, the possibilities are endless! 💪</p>\n<p>So there you have it, my extraordinary Excel adventure at Domino’s Pizza. Who would have thought that a simple task like dough tags would lead me down the path of Excel wizardry? 🌟✨</p>\n<p>Never underestimate the power of a curious mind and the vast capabilities of Microsoft Excel. Remember, with a little creativity and the right tools, you can build a whole new software-like system right within Excel itself. 🚀💻</p>\n<p>Stay curious, keep exploring, and who knows what other wonders await us in the world of spreadsheets! 🌈📊</p>\n",

I was just learning JavaScript and wanted to turn the memes into a fun web app.</p>\n<p>Spoiler alert: it took me a whole month to build 😅 (yes, I was a total beginner).</p>\n<p>The project was built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no fancy stacks, just good old basics 🔧🧱</p>\n<p>👉 Check it out here: <a href=\"https://git.hsinghhira.me/LookBro/\">Git.hsinghhira.me&#x2F;LookBro&#x2F;</a></p>\n<p>For styling, I used my comfort blanket — Bootstrap 🧶.</p>\n<p>At that point, I had already used it in most of my mini projects, and it made responsive design way easier 📱💻</p>\n<p>I also threw in Normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher to make sure the site didn’t look like a mess on different browsers 🧹🖥️</p>\n<p>For turning text into image (yup, like meme magic 🧙‍♂️✨), I used Fabric.js — a super handy HTML5 canvas library with all kinds of cool interactive features.</p>\n<p>It even supports SVG-to-canvas conversions, which made things feel extra pro 💼</p>\n<p>Changing text colors? That was powered by Prism.js by Lea Verou 🌈</p>\n<p>(Technically meant for syntax highlighting, but hey, we adapt 😎)</p>\n<p>For the character selection box on the side, I used nanoScroller.js by James F.</p>\n<p>Think Mac-style scrollbars, but for us mere mortals 🖱️🍏</p>\n<p>Picking colors was made easy with JSColor.js by Jan Odvarko — a cute little color picker that just worked 🎨👌</p>\n<p>And lastly, I tried to make things social by using socialShare.js by Ritesh Kumar — sadly, it’s now deprecated (RIP 🪦), but it used to let you control social buttons like a boss.</p>\n<p>Of course, holding all this together was good ol’ jQuery v2.1.0. A classic. Can’t forget the OG 💾💙</p>\n<p>Moral of the story? I started small, learned a ton, and had a blast building something people could actually use (and laugh at 😄).</p>\n<p>Still one of my fav beginner projects to date 💯</p>\n",
