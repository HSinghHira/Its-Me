&lt;p&gt;Hey there, once again but this time for my fellow gamers! 🎮 Today, I want to share with you a thrilling story about a unique project I undertook called Muerte KOD. Brace yourself for a tale of intrigue, innovation, and a touch of darkness!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But First, What on Earth is Muerte KOD? 😯❓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, the name might raise a few eyebrows. So, let me clarify: Muerte, which means “death” or “murder” in English, was a “legal” Windows software designed to enhance the gaming experience for the immensely popular game, PUBG Mobile. Now, before you call the authorities on me, let me assure you that the software itself didn’t do anything wrong. It simply consisted of a collection of small tools aimed at helping players enjoy the game to the fullest. 😅🔧&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating Muerte KOD was both a challenge and an opportunity for me. It marked my first and, so far, my last venture into software development using Microsoft Visual Studio. I poured my heart and soul into this project, striving to provide as many useful features as possible for the gamers. 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dedicated countless hours to refining the software, ensuring that it not only delivered the desired functionality but also boasted an improved visual design. After all, a visually appealing interface can truly elevate the gaming experience. 🚀🎨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muerte KOD, with its name meaning “death” or “murder” in English, added an extra layer of intrigue to this exhilarating journey. Although the software aimed to enhance gameplay through various tools like MAC address spoofing, Defender Injector, Flush DNS, Advanced DNS Changer, HDD ID Changer, and more, it’s important to note that it was all within the realm of legality. No rules were broken, I promise! 😉🔒&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Muerte KOD stands as my first and, for now, my last software endeavor using Microsoft Visual Studio, I cherish the experience and the knowledge gained along the way. It serves as a testament to the limitless possibilities that await us in the realm of game enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fellow gamers, keep exploring, keep innovating, and let’s continue to push the boundaries of what we can achieve in the world! Game on! 🎮🌟&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey there, folks! 🍕 Today, I want to share with you an incredible story from my time working at Domino’s Pizza. It all started with a simple task: putting dough tags on newly made dough batches. It was a crucial health and safety requirement, and I hope they still follow it. But little did I know that this experience would lead me down a rabbit hole of Excel wonders. 🎩💻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, during a not-so-busy shift, I couldn’t help but notice that the dough tags we were using weren’t exactly visually appealing. You know, they lacked that wow factor. 🤔 So, when I got home, I decided to fire up Excel on my laptop to see if I could create better-looking tags. A quick Google search for inspiration, and voila! I had some good-looking tags ready to go. 🏷️🌟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, it hit me. I would still have to manually enter all the details for each tag. 🙇‍♀️ Determined to find a solution, I hit the search button once again and stumbled upon the magnificent world of Macros and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications for full, I know fancy name 😑). 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With newfound knowledge, I started with a simple file. It was nothing fancy, just a basic automation to ease the manual data entry process. Little did I know that this was just the beginning of an exciting journey. Every step of the way, I continued to develop and improve my Excel project. 📈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I created something truly remarkable. If you’re curious to see the different versions I released, head over to the GitHub repository. Unfortunately, I must confess that I no longer remember the password for the VBA, so you won’t be able to view the codes behind the magic. 🧙‍♂️ (maybe decrypt the file and tell me the password too 🤣)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is a true testament to the wonders of Excel and VBA. Despite not remembering much about VBA or even how to perform simple calculations in Excel, I somehow managed to create this masterpiece. It’s like a puzzle I solved without remembering how I did it. 🧩💡&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And guess what? If the need arises, I can create an even better Excel project than this one. Trust me, the possibilities are endless! 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, my extraordinary Excel adventure at Domino’s Pizza. Who would have thought that a simple task like dough tags would lead me down the path of Excel wizardry? 🌟✨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never underestimate the power of a curious mind and the vast capabilities of Microsoft Excel. Remember, with a little creativity and the right tools, you can build a whole new software-like system right within Excel itself. 🚀💻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay curious, keep exploring, and who knows what other wonders await us in the world of spreadsheets! 🌈📊&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay this is kinda funny… but yep, I actually made &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; Dekh Bhai Meme Creator back in 2016 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was school days, Dekh Bhai memes were popping off in India, and apparently I couldn’t get enough of them. So I built a second version — because why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already talked about the first one in my older blog post (built with good ol’ JavaScript), but this time I decided to switch things up and write the whole thing in PHP 💻🐘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fun little experiment and honestly, I learned a bunch about PHP along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no live demo for this one (RIP hosting 😅), but the code’s chilling on GitHub if you’re curious! 🛠️📂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are the Codes 🧑‍💻:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple PHP file Github Gist: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/HSinghHira/7094b6285aa017def77e664c75230975&#34;&gt;https://gist.github.com/HSinghHira/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full PHP Script: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/HSinghHira/Dekh-Bhai-Meme-Creator/&#34;&gt;https://github.com/HSinghHira/Dekh-Bhai-Meme-Creator/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2016, before I moved to New Zealand 🇳🇿, I decided to challenge myself with a lil’ side project 💻.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, &lt;em&gt;“Dekh Bhai”&lt;/em&gt; memes were EVERYWHERE in India — if you know, you know 😎.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Dekh Bhai&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x3D; “Look, brother” for my non-desi friends 👀🧔)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought, why not try building something around it? I was just learning JavaScript and wanted to turn the memes into a fun web app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: it took me a whole month to build 😅 (yes, I was a total beginner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no fancy stacks, just good old basics 🔧🧱&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👉 Check it out here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.hsinghhira.me/LookBro/&#34;&gt;Git.hsinghhira.me&amp;#x2F;LookBro&amp;#x2F;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For styling, I used my comfort blanket — Bootstrap 🧶.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I had already used it in most of my mini projects, and it made responsive design way easier 📱💻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also threw in Normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher to make sure the site didn’t look like a mess on different browsers 🧹🖥️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For turning text into image (yup, like meme magic 🧙‍♂️✨), I used Fabric.js — a super handy HTML5 canvas library with all kinds of cool interactive features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even supports SVG-to-canvas conversions, which made things feel extra pro 💼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing text colors? That was powered by Prism.js by Lea Verou 🌈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Technically meant for syntax highlighting, but hey, we adapt 😎)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the character selection box on the side, I used nanoScroller.js by James F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think Mac-style scrollbars, but for us mere mortals 🖱️🍏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking colors was made easy with JSColor.js by Jan Odvarko — a cute little color picker that just worked 🎨👌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, I tried to make things social by using socialShare.js by Ritesh Kumar — sadly, it’s now deprecated (RIP 🪦), but it used to let you control social buttons like a boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, holding all this together was good ol’ jQuery v2.1.0. A classic. Can’t forget the OG 💾💙&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story? I started small, learned a ton, and had a blast building something people could actually use (and laugh at 😄).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still one of my fav beginner projects to date 💯&lt;/p&gt;

            <description><![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;Hey there, fellow learners! 🌟 Today, I want to share with you an awesome AWS Cloud Practitioner Practice Quiz that I created while I was learning AWS Cloud Engineering. 🚀 It’s not super fancy, but I made sure to keep it simple and easy to understand. Let’s dive in and have some fun while testing our knowledge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/20250720_174941_aws.png&#34; alt=&#34;AWS Cloud Practitioner Practice Quiz - JS Based&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View Live Preview: &lt;a href=&#34;https://quiz.hsinghhira.me/AWS-Cloud-Practitioner/&#34;&gt;https://quiz.hsinghhira.me/AWS-Cloud-Practitioner/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quiz may not have all the bells and whistles, but it has all the essential features you’d expect from any quiz website. 🎯 Here’s what you can expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**1. Colorful Feedback: ** When you select a wrong answer, it will be highlighted in red, while the correct answer will be highlighted in green. 🟥🟩 This way, you’ll know exactly where you went wrong and where you excelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Customizable Questions:&lt;/strong&gt; You can set the number of questions you want to tackle. 📝 Behind the scenes, you can add as many questions as you want, giving you the flexibility to challenge yourself at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**3. Randomized Questions: ** Each time you take the quiz, it will present you with random questions and options. 🎲 This keeps things exciting and ensures that you never know what the next question will be. It’s like a surprise every time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this quiz possible, I used the power of JavaScript. 🚀 By leveraging JavaScript, I was able to create a dynamic experience for you, right on a static webpage. How cool is that? 💻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the visual styling, I employed the popular CSS framework called Bootstrap v5.1.0. 🎨 This helped me quickly achieve a clean and professional look without spending too much time on the aesthetics. And of course, what’s a quiz without some icons? I used the awesome Font Awesome Icons to give the quiz a touch of visual appeal. 🌟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit, this quiz was a bit of a rush project. So, while I didn’t spend a lot of time on its looks, I made sure it works perfectly and offers you plenty of options to enhance your learning experience. 📚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you find this quiz both educational and enjoyable. Give it a try, challenge yourself, and let’s see how well you know your AWS Cloud Practitioner knowledge! Remember, learning can be fun too! 🌈📚💡&lt;/p&gt;
